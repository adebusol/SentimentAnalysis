Sentiment analysis using an unsupervised lexicon-based approach (TextBlob)
The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has no doubt had an enormous impact on people’s lives. It has led to social distancing and enforcement of the mask mandate. Twitter, a microblogging site where people share their views and opinions on social and political issues offer a way to share sentiment. I analyzed 5000 tweets from 2022 relating to the lifting of mask mandate to understand people’s public opinion on wearing masks. The results from this project showed that more people have positive sentiments towards the lifting of the mask mandate.
